EV Charge Demand Forecasting
This repository contains a project focused on forecasting Electric Vehicle (EV) charge demand. The project leverages historical data to predict future charging needs, which can be crucial for optimizing charging infrastructure, grid management, and energy distribution.

üåü Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles raw EV charging data to prepare it for model training.

Machine Learning Model: Implements a forecasting model (likely time-series based) to predict EV charge demand.

Model Persistence: Saves the trained model for future use.

Interactive Application: Provides a web application (via app.py) to interact with the forecasting model.

Data Analysis: Includes a Jupyter Notebook for detailed exploratory data analysis and model development.

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For data exploration, analysis, and model development.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn / Other ML Libraries: For building and training the forecasting model (inferred from .pkl file).

Streamlit / Flask (inferred from app.py): For creating the web application.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shubanborkar/EV-Charge-Demand.git
cd EV-Charge-Demand

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üìà Usage
Running the Forecasting Application
To run the interactive web application, execute the app.py script:

python app.py

This will typically start a local web server, and you can access the application through your web browser (the console will provide the URL, usually http://localhost:8501 if Streamlit is used).

Exploring the Jupyter Notebook
The EV_Forecasting.ipynb notebook contains the detailed steps for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can open and run it using Jupyter:

Start Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Navigate to EV_Forecasting.ipynb and open it.
